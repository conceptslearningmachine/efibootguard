## Watchdog support ##

The following watchdog drivers are implemented:
* Intel Quark
* Intel TCO
* Intel i6300esb

Note that if no working watchdog is found, the boot process deliberately fails.
That said, setting a watchdog timeout of `0` allows to boot nonetheless without
a working watchdog, e.g., for testing purposes.

## Configuration ##

`efibootguard` reads its configuration from an environment storage. Currently,
the following environment backends are implemented:
* Dual FAT Partition storage

See `Installation And Usage` for further information.
